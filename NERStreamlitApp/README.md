# ðŸ”¥ NER Streamlit App

## ðŸ“š Overview  
Welcome to the **NER Streamlit App**! This interactive application lets you perform Named Entity Recognition using **spaCy** and **Streamlit**. You can enter your own text or load a sample, define custom entity rules, and see real-time results with intuitive visualizations. This project is part of my Elements of Computing II portfolio.

## âœ¨ Features  
- **Flexible Text Input:**  
  Choose to type/paste text, upload a `.txt` file, or load one of the sample texts from the sidebar.

  Recognized entities are displayed in two columns for clarity, and the app shows highlighted text annotated with entities.
