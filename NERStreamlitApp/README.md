# üî• NER Streamlit App

## üìö Overview  
Welcome to the **NER Streamlit App**! This interactive tool allows you to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) using **spaCy** and **Streamlit**. You can input custom text, define entity rules, and instantly visualize the results. This project was developed as part of my Elements of Computing II portfolio.

---

## ‚ú® Features  
- **Flexible Text Input**  
  Type/paste your own text, upload a `.txt` file, or use one of the built-in sample texts.

- **Custom Entity Rules**  
  Add custom rules by specifying an entity label (e.g., `PERSON`, `ORG`) and a matching pattern (e.g., `"Barack Obama"`).  
  Rules are displayed in an expandable list and can be cleared at any time.

- **Interactive Visualizations**  
  View recognized entities in a clean two-column layout, along with a color-highlighted version of your text.

- **Entity Statistics**  
  See a count of all detected entities, with a breakdown by type (e.g., PERSON, ORG, GPE).

- **Built-in Help & Documentation**  
  The sidebar includes instructions and external links to spaCy and Streamlit documentation.
