# 🐍 Python Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Python projects repository! Here, I showcase interactive applications and data analysis projects built using **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, and other tools. My goal is to turn raw data into meaningful insights while improving my coding skills.

## 📌 Project List

### 🏅 [2008 Olympic Medalists - Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/GooboGobbo/TidyData-Project)
This project focuses on **cleaning and visualizing** the 2008 Olympic medalist dataset using **tidy data principles**.  
Key features:
- Used **Pandas `melt()`** to restructure the dataset.
- Extracted gender and event details from messy data.
- Created **pivot tables** to display medal counts by event and gender.
- Developed an **interactive Streamlit app** for users to explore medalists, events, and medals won.

📊 This project demonstrates my ability to handle **messy data**, apply **data transformation techniques**, and build **interactive applications**.

### 🐧 [Palmer's Penguins - Interactive Data App](https://github.com/GooboGobbo/Edge-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app)
This **Streamlit-powered web app** allows users to explore the **Palmer's Penguins dataset**, filtering penguins based on species and body mass.

#### Features:
- **Dropdown selection** to view penguins by species.
- **Interactive slider** to filter penguins by body mass.
- **Live data updates** showing filtered results instantly.
  
📊 This project showcases my skills in **data visualization**, **interactive UI design**, and **working with real-world datasets**.

### 🧠 [NER Streamlit App – Custom Named Entity Recognition Tool](https://github.com/GooboGobbo/NERStreamlitApp)
This app allows users to explore **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using the `spaCy` library and `Streamlit`, with full support for **custom rule creation** through spaCy’s `EntityRuler`.

#### Features:
- 📝 **Text Input Options** – Type, paste, upload `.txt` files, or load sample texts via the sidebar.
- 🏷️ **Custom Rules** – Users can define custom entity labels (e.g., `PERSON`, `ORG`) and text patterns (e.g., "Notre Dame").
- 🔍 **Real-Time NER Processing** – Results are displayed instantly with entities highlighted and summarized.
- 📊 **Entity Statistics** – A breakdown of entity types and counts is shown for every processed input.
- 🎨 **Custom UI Theme** – The app features a dark mode with Notre Dame-inspired styling and polished layout.

📌 This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Integrate advanced NLP tools (`spaCy`) into real-time applications
- Build **interactive user experiences** with Streamlit
- Apply **custom logic (EntityRuler)** to extend pretrained machine learning models
- Handle file uploads, state management, and custom styling
