## 📌 Project List

### 🏅 [2008 Olympic Medalists - Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/GooboGobbo/TidyData-Project)
This project focuses on **cleaning and visualizing** the 2008 Olympic medalist dataset using **tidy data principles**.  
Key features:
- Used **Pandas `melt()`** to restructure the dataset.
- Extracted gender and event details from messy data.
- Created **pivot tables** to display medal counts by event and gender.
- Developed an **interactive Streamlit app** for users to explore medalists, events, and medals won.

📊 This project demonstrates my ability to handle **messy data**, apply **data transformation techniques**, and build **interactive applications**.
