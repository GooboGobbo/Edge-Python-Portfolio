# 👨‍💻 My Coding Portfolio  

Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find a selection of projects that showcase my skills in coding and data analysis. I’m passionate about turning raw data into meaningful insights and creating interactive applications. Below are my key projects.

---

## 📌 Purpose  
This repository is for the posting of my Python coding projects.

---

## 📂 Plan for Organization  
I plan to use folders that are appropriately named and organized as well as visuals and models that are clean and relevant to my material.

## 🚀 Notable Projects  

### 🐧 Streamlit App - Palmer's Penguins  
An interactive app allowing you to see certain penguins based on island and body mass.  

### 🏅 [2008 Olympic Medalists - Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/GooboGobbo/Edge-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)  
In this project, I cleaned and visualized the 2008 Olympic medalist dataset using **tidy data principles**. I used **pandas** to restructure the dataset with the `melt()` function, split event names to extract gender and event details, and created pivot tables to show medal counts by event and gender. The project is fully interactive with **Streamlit**, where users can explore medalists, events, and gender-based medal counts.  

This project complements my overall coding portfolio by demonstrating my ability to work with raw data, apply data-cleaning techniques, and build interactive applications.
