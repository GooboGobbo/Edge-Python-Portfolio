# 🐍 Python Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Python projects repository! Here, I showcase interactive applications and data analysis projects built using **Streamlit**, **spaCy**, **Pandas**, and more. My goal is to turn raw data into meaningful insights while strengthening my programming and UI design skills.

## 📌 Project List

### 🇰🇷 [Learn Korean: Mini Games Hub](https://github.com/GooboGobbo/Edge-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/StreamlitAppFinal)

A full-featured **Streamlit app** designed to help beginners learn Korean through four interactive mini-games:  
- ✍️ **Romanization ➔ Hangul** typing game  
- 📝 **Vocabulary Quiz** from English to Hangul  
- 🏎️ **Korean TypeRacer** with timed sentence typing  
- ⏳ **Tense Selector** to test Korean verb conjugation

📚 The app also includes **sidebars with grammar guides** and persistent score tracking across sessions.

💡 I built this project to **connect with my Korean heritage** and offer a fun, gamified experience for new learners — something I wish I had when I began learning the language.

🧠 This project demonstrates:
- **Multi-tab Streamlit interactivity**
- State handling, layout design, and UX polish
- **Educational game logic** and text feedback

### 🧠 [NER Streamlit App – Custom Named Entity Recognition Tool](https://github.com/GooboGobbo/Edge-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/NERStreamlitApp)

A custom **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** interface using `spaCy` and `Streamlit`, with full support for rule-based entity creation.

#### Features:
- Upload or paste any text
- Define custom entity rules (e.g., `ORG`, `PERSON`)
- Real-time recognition and display using `displacy`
- **Entity statistics**, rule management, and live highlights

📌 This app demonstrates:
- Integrating **NLP models** into a UI
- Managing **custom logic via `EntityRuler`**
- Clean design and useful feedback for real-time learning

### 🏅 [2008 Olympic Medalists - Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/GooboGobbo/Edge-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)

An interactive data cleaning and visualization app for the 2008 Olympic medalist dataset using **Pandas** and **Streamlit**.

#### Features:
- Applied **tidy data principles** (`melt`, `dropna`, `str.split`, `rename`)
- Built pivot tables and bar charts to explore medal counts by gender and event
- Added interactive filters to view medalists by athlete or event

📊 This project highlights my ability to **clean messy data**, transform it into structured formats, and build clear, interactive visualizations.

### 🐧 [Palmer's Penguins - Interactive Data App](https://github.com/GooboGobbo/Edge-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app)

A simple yet functional **Streamlit app** for exploring the popular Palmer Penguins dataset.

#### Features:
- Filter penguins by **species** and **body mass**
- Real-time updates and clean, interactive layout

📊 This was my first exploration with Streamlit and showcases my early grasp of **data filtering** and building **user-driven dashboards**.
