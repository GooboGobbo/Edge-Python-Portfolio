# 🇰🇷 Learn Korean: Mini Games Hub 🎮

Welcome to the **Learn Korean Mini Games Hub**, an interactive web-based platform that helps beginner Korean learners improve their language skills through a variety of fun and focused mini-games.

This project was created as part of my final assignment for *Elements of Computing II*. I built it because I found it surprisingly difficult to find Korean learning apps that combine multiple game modes in one place. Most apps only focus on flashcards or grammar — so I set out to build something better.

## 📌 Features

The app is designed with a clean multi-tab layout and includes four engaging mini-games:

| Game | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ✍️ **Romanization ➔ Hangul** | Practice typing correct Hangul based on the Romanized Korean word. Tracks progress and streaks. |
| 📝 **Vocabulary Quiz** | Pick the correct Korean word for a given English prompt from multiple choices. Fully randomized. |
| 🏎️ **Korean TypeRacer** | Choose between Easy or Hard difficulty and test your typing speed in Korean. Tracks best times. |
| ⏳ **Tense Selector** | Choose the correct Korean verb tense (past, present, future) based on the English sentence. Includes grammar sidebar guide. |

Each game is self-contained and allows you to reset for a new challenge at any time. Feedback, streaks, and total correct/attempts are tracked per game.
